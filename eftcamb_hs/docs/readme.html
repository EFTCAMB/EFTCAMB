<A NAME="Intro"><h2  style ="color:darkred">Introduction</h2></A>
CosmoMC is a Fortran 2008 Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) engine for exploring cosmological
parameter space, together with Fortran and python code for analysing Monte-Carlo samples and importance sampling (plus a suite of scripts for building grids of runs, plotting and presenting results).
The code does brute force (but accurate) theoretical matter power spectrum and <I>C<sub>l</sub></I> calculations with
<a href="http://camb.info/">CAMB</a>. See the original <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205436">paper</a>
for an introduction and descriptions, and up-to-date <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4473">sampling algorithm</A> details. It can also be compiled as a <A HREF="#Generic">generic sampler</A> without using any cosmology codes.
<P>
On a multi-processor machine you can start to get good results in a few of hours. On single processors
you'll need to set aside rather longer. You can also run on a cluster.

<p>By default CosmoMC uses a simple Metropolis algorithm or an optimized fast-slow sampling method (which works for likelihood with many fast nuisance parameters like Planck).
The program takes as inputs estimates of central values and posterior uncertainties of the various parameters. The proposal density can use information about parameter correlations from a supplied covariance matrix: use one if possible as it will significantly improve performance. Covariance matrices are supplied for common sets of default base parameters. If you compile and run with <A HREF="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/">MPI</A> (to run across nodes in a cluster), there is an option to dynamically
learn the proposal matrix from the covariance of the post-burn-in samples so far. The MPI option also allows you to terminate the computation automatically when a particular convergence criterion is matched. MPI is strongly recommended.

<p>There are two programs supplied <B>cosmomc</B> and <B>getdist</B>. The first is a compiled Fortran code
does the actual Monte-Carlo and produces sets of .txt chain files and (optionally) .data output
files (the binary .data files include the theoretical CMB power spectra
etc.).  The "cosmomc" program can also do post processing on .data files, for example doing importance
sampling with new data. The "getdist" program analyses the .txt files calculating statistics
and outputs files for the requested 1D, 2D and 3D plots (and could be used independently of the main cosmomc program), and there are Fortran and python versions.
The Python version is is the most up to date, and output is not the same as the fortran version (which is mainly provided for backwards checking and reproducing Planck results). GetDist is included with CosmoMC, but can be also run quite separately from the standalone <A HREF="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GetDist/">python package</A>. The "cosmomc" program also does post processing on .data files, for example doing importance
sampling with new data.
<P>
Please e-mail details of any bugs or enhancements to <a href="http://cosmologist.info/">Antony Lewis</a>. If you have any questions please ask in the <A HREF="http://cosmocoffee.info">CosmoCoffee</A> computers and software forum. You can also read answers to other people's questions there.



<A NAME="Compiling"><h2  style ="color:darkred">Downloading and Compiling</h2></A>
To run compile and run CosmoMC you will need a Fortran 2008 compiler. Various options include
<UL>
<LI>Intel Fortran 14 or higher (earlier versions will not work). This is usually installed on supercomputers.
<LI>The latest gfortran (part of GCC 6) compiled from source  (currently released versions do not work).
<LI>A pre-configured virtual development environment, available from <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/CosmoBox">CosmoBox</A>. <br>
<i>This is good for consistent development and debugging, and ensures required libraries are also available. There are both desktop virtual machine (and Docker) images, and an Amazon AWS image that can be used for running clusters in the cloud.</i>
</UL>
If you just want to analyse chains and run plots, you only need python 2.7+ or 3.4+ (see <A HREF="#Analysing">plotting</A> below).
<P>
You then need to download and install the program:
<ul>
<li>Get the <a href="http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/submit.html">download</a> (or clone from git)
<li>Extract the files with
<pre>
tar xvf cosmomc.tar.gz
</pre>
<li>Change to the cosmomc directory and run "make"
<br>
<i>To use Planck data you need to download and install the Planck likelihood code and data first. See the <A HREF="readme_planck.html">Planck readme</A>.
The Makefiles used by "make" should detect ifort and gfortran, but if necessary edit the relevant top parts of the Makefile in the source directory depending on what system you are using.</i>
<li>To output chains you might want to make a <b>chains</b> subdirectory, or (perhaps better) symlink to somewhere on your data disk.
</ul>

By default the build uses MPI. Using MPI simplifies running several chains and proposal optimization. MPI can be used with OpenMP for parallelization of each chain. Generally you want to use OpenMP to use all the shared-memory processors on each node of a cluster, and MPI to run multiple chains on different nodes (the program can also just be run on a single CPU).
<p>
For code editing some project files are available for standard development environments:
<ul>
<LI>A CodeBlocks project file is provided (cosmomc.cbp), which can also be used to run and debug from the cross-platform <A hREF="http://darmar.vgtu.lt/">CodeBlocks IDE</A>.
<LI>On Windows using Visual Fortran, open the solution file in the VisualStudio folder.<br>
  <i>Set test.ini (or your .ini file) as the program argument. This is not set up to compile with MPI, so mainly useful for development. Visual Fortran does not use the provided Makefiles, but works out dependencies automatically (and has much better debugging support than gdb with CodeBlocks).</i>
</ul><P>

<A NAME="Running"><h2  style ="color:darkred">Running and input parameters</h2></A>
<P>
See the supplied <B>params.ini</B> file for a fairly self-explanatory list of
input parameters and options. The <b>file_root</b> entry gives the root name for all files produced. Running using MPI on a cluster is recommended if possible as you can automatically handle convergence testing and stopping.
<!--<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="blue">Running individual chains</FONT></B> (not recommended)<BR>
 <BR>

Run the program using
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>./cosmomc params.ini</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The samples will be in file_root.txt, etc. You can start several instances of the program generating separate chains using
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>./cosmomc params.ini 1<BR>
 ./cosmomc params.ini 2
  </B><BR>
etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In this case samples will be in the files file_root_NN.txt, where NN labels the chain number.
<BR><BR>
-->
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="blue">MPI runs on a cluster</FONT></B><BR><BR>
When you run with MPI (compiled with -DMPI, the default), a number of chains will be run according to the number of processes assigned by MPI when you run the program. Output file names will have "_1","_2" appended to the root name automatically. You may be able to run over 4 nodes using e.g.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>mpirun -np 4 ./cosmomc params.ini</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
There is also a supplied script python/runMPI.py that you may be able to adapt for submitting jobs to a job queue, e.g.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <B>python python/runMPI.py params</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 to run using the params.ini parameters file. Run runMPI.py without arguments to see a list of options (number of chains, cores, wall time, etc).
 You will probably need to set up a job script template file for your computer cluster (a couple of samples are supplied). See <A HREF="#jobscript">Configuring job settings for your machine</A>. If you want to run batches of chains with different parameter or data combinations, see the help file on setting up <A HREF="./readme_grids.html">parameter grids</A>.
 <BR><BR>
 In the parameters file you can set <B>MPI_Converge_Stop</B> to a convergence criterion (see <A HREF="#Convergence">Convergence Diagnostics</A>. Small numbers are better convergence; generally need R-1 < 0.1, but may want much smaller especially for importance sampling or accurate confidence limits. You can also directly impose an error limit on confidence values - see the parameter input file for details). If you set <B>MPI_LearnPropose</B> = T, the proposal density will be updated using the covariance matrix of the last half of all samples (across chains) so far. <BR><BR>
Using MPI_LearnPropose will significantly improve performance if you are adding new parameters for which you don't have a pre-computed covariance matrix. However adjusting the proposal density is not strictly Markovian, though asymptotically it is as the covariance will converge. The burn in period should therefore be taken to be larger when learning the proposal density to allow for the time it takes the covariance matrix to converge sufficiently (though in practice it probably doesn't matter much in most cases). Note also that as the proposal density changes the number of steps between independent samples is not constant (i.e. the correlation length should decrease along the chain until the covariance has converged). The stopping criterion uses the last half of the samples in each chain, minus a (shortish) initial burn in period. If you don't have a starting covariance matrix a fairly safe thing to do is set <B>ignore_rows=0.3</B> in the <A HREF="#Analysing">GetDist</A> parameter file to skip the first chunk of each chain. <BR><BR>
You can also set the <B>MPI_R_StopProposeUpdate</B> parameter to stop updating the proposal density after it has converged to R-1 smaller than a specified number. After this point the chain will be strictly Markovian. The number of burn in rows can be calculated by looking at the params.log file for the number of output lines at which R-1 has reached the required value.
<P>
If things go wrong check the .log and any error files in your cosmomc/scripts directory.
</UL>
</P>
<A NAME="Input">
<B><FONT COLOR="blue">Input Parameters</FONT></B>
<BR><BR>
The input .ini files contain sets of name-value pairs, in the form <b>key = value</b>.
<BR><BR>
Keys setting input values for specific parameters can be set using numbered key values, param[omegabh2]=xxx yy... for omegabh2. The names of the various parameters are set in .paramnames files: for cosmology parameters see params_CMB.paramnames. Likelihoods may also have nuisance parameters that need to be varied: see the .paramnames files in the ./data/  directory.
<BR><BR>
.ini files can include other ini files using DEFAULT(xx.ini) or INCLUDE(yy.ini), so there's no need to repeat lots of settings when you do different similar runs. The sample test.ini file includes .ini files in the batch2/ directory, set up for Planck runs. The <b>action=4</b> setting just calculates test likelihoods for one model (the central value of your parameter ranges) and writes out the result. Set <b>action=0</b> to run a test chain. Using DEFAULT in a .ini files means you can include default settings, but override ones of interest for a particular run.
<UL>

<LI><B>Parameter limits and proposal density</B><BR>
The parameter limits, estimated distribution widths and starting points are listed
as the <B>param[paramname]</B> variables for each parameter, of the form
<pre>
 param[paramname] = center min max start_width propose_width
</pre>
The <em>start_width</em> entry determines the randomly chosen dispersion of the starting position about the given <i>centre</i>, and should  be as large or larger than the posterior (for the convergence diagnostic to be reliable, chains should start at widely separated points). Chains are restricted to stay within the bounds determined by <i>min</i> and <i>max</i>. If the parameter is not to be varied in your run, you can just specify the fixed value.
<p>
 The sampler proposes changes in parameters using a proposal density function with a width determined by <i>propose_width</i> (multiplied by the value of the global <B>propose_scale</B> parameter).  The <em>propose_width</em> should be of the order of the conditional posterior width (i.e. the expected error in that parameter when other parameters are fixed). If you specify a <b>propose_matrix</b>
(approximate covariance matrix for the parameters), the
parameter distribution widths are determined from its eigenvalues instead, and
the proposal density changes the parameter eigenvectors. The covariance
matrix can be computed using "getdist" once you have done one run - the file_root.covmat file.
 The planck_covmats/ directory is supplied with many you can use. The covariance matrix does not have to include all the parameters that are used - zero entries will be updated from the input propose widths of new parameters (the propose width should be of the size of the conditional distribution of the parameter - typically quite a bit smaller than the marginalized posterior width; generally too small is better than too large).  The scale of the proposal density relative to the covariance is given by the <B>propose_scale</B> parameter. If your propose_matrix is significantly broader than the expected posterior, this number can be decreased.
<p>
If you don't have a propose_matrix, you can use <B>estimate_propose_matrix</B> = T to automatically estimate it by numerical fitting about the best fit point (with <b>action</b>=2 to stop, or <b>action</b>=0 to continue straight into an MCMC run).

<BR><BR>
<LI><A NAME="sampling"></A><B>Sampling method</B><BR>
Set <B>sampling_method</B>=1 to use a vanilla Metropolis algorithm (in the optimal fast/slow subspaces if <b>use_fast_slow</b> is true).
Set <B>sampling_method</B>=7 to use a fast-slow dragging algorithm (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/math.ST/0502099">Neal 2005</A>), which allows fast nuisance parameters to be handled efficiently; this is the default for Planck runs.
<P>
Other sampling methods that were implemented in previous version have not currently been updated for the latest version.
<!--
Other options are slice sampling (2), slice sampling fast parameters (3), and directional gridding (4). These methods should work fine for most simple distributions; the temperature input parameter can be increased to probe further into the tails if required (e.g. to get better high-confidence limits). Further sampling_method options that you can try for nastier (e.g. multi-modal distributions) are multicanonical sampling (5) and Wang-Landau-like sampling (6). These latter methods could be modified to calculate the evidence, but at the moment are only implemented to sample nastier distributions via importance sampling. Multicanonical sampling probes into the tails a distance proportional to the running time, and all samples can be kept if the distribution turns out to be unimodal. The Wang-Landau-like sampling probes the full likelihood range from the word go, and produces no samples for the first 10,000 or so steps (thereafter all samples are strictly Markovian may be kept without burn in). Methods 5 and 6 can be used with MPI, but MPI stopping should probably be turned off; MPI proposal learning may work with method 6, though this is not extensively tested. Both are likely to require <B>samples = 100000</B> or larger, hence significantly slow than a basic MCMC run for simple distributions. Settings for methods 5 and 6 can be edited at the top of MCMC.f90. See the  <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/CosmoMC.pdf">notes</A> for a more detailed explanation of sampling methods.
<BR><BR>
-->
<LI><B>CAMB's numerical accuracy</B><BR>
The default accuracy is aimed at WMAP. Set <B>high_accuracy_default = T</B> to target ~0.1% accuracy on the CMB power spectra from CAMB. This is sufficient for numerical biases to be small compared to the error bar for Planck; for an accuracy study see <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3654">arXiv:1201.3654</A>. You can also use the <B>accuracy_level</b> parameter to increase accuracy further, however this is numerically inefficient and is best used mainly for numerical stability checks using importance sampling (<b>action=1</b>).
<BR><BR>

<LI><B>Best-fit point</B><BR>

Set <B>action</B> =2 to just calculate the best-fit point and stop (also outputting a .covmat estimate from the inverse Hessian if  <b>estimate_propose_matrix</b>=T). As of Oct 2012 this uses
<A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/na/NA_papers/NA2009_06.pdf">Powell's  2009 BOBYQA</A> bounded minimization routine, which works from two parameters up to hundreds of parameters, but does require that the likelihood return a valid number at all points between the bounds given on the base parameters in the input .ini file. The algorithm starts at the point given by the <i>center</i> parameter values given in the .ini file, and iterates until the parameter values are converged to within a radius of  <b>max_like_radius</b> in units of the input parameter <i>propose width</i>s; by default <i>max_like_radius = 0.01</i>.
 <!--(the convergence criterion is a radius in nD space; <em>max_like_radius</em> is scaled by the root of the number of parameters so that on average each parameter is converged to a fraction <em>max_like_radius</em> of its <em>propose_width</em>). -->
 The best-fit values (and derived and nuisance parameters) are output to a file called <em>file_root</em>.minimum. The method works for parameters with hard bounds that truncate the posterior, e.g. for neutrino mass mnu>0. It does not use the propose_matrix, only the input parameter bounds, center and propose_width.
<BR><BR>
action=2 only runs on one node, so compile without MPI or run only one MPI instance. Note that the minimizer appears not to be totally reliable for Planck (may stop not at the global minimum) - starting at different points can be a good check.
<BR><BR>

<LI><B>Data file output</B><BR>
Since consecutive points are correlated and the output files can get quite large, you may want to thin the chains automatically: set the <b>indep_sample</b> parameter to determine at what frequency full information is dumped to a binary .data file (which includes the Cls, matter power spectrum, parameters, etc). If zero no .data file is generated. You only need to keep nearly uncorrelated samples for later importance sampling. You can specify a <b>burn_in</b>, though you may prefer to set this
to zero and remove entries when you come to process the output samples.
<BR><BR>


<LI><B>Threads and run-time adjustment</B><BR>
The <b>num_threads</b> parameter will determine the number of openMP threads (in MPI runs, usually set to the number of CPUs on each node). Scaling is linear up to about 8 processors on most systems, then
falls off slowly. It is probably best to run several chains on 8 or fewer
processors. You can terminate a run before it finishes by creating a file
called file_root_NN.read containing "exit =1" - it will read it in, delete the .read file and stop.
The .read file can also have "num_threads =xx" to change the number of
threads (per chain) dynamically. If you have multiple chains you can create file_root.read which will be read by all the chains. In this case the .read file is not deleted automatically.<BR><BR>

<LI><B>Post-processing (e.g. importance sampling)</B><BR>

The <b>action</b> variable determines what to do. Use action=1 to process
a .data file produced by a previous MCMC run - this is used for importance
sampling with new data, correcting results generated by approximate means,
or re-calculating the theoretical predictions in more detail. If action=1
set the redo_xxx parameters to determine what to do. With <B>redo_add=F</B> you should include all the data you want used for the final result (e.g. if you generated original samples with CMB data, also include CMB data when you importance sample - it will not be weighted twice). With <B>redo_add=T</B> you should include only data you want to add - the new likelihoods are added to those already stored in the chains. PostProcessing is fastest if you have binary .data files from an original run, however if you do not have these you can use <B>redo_from_text=T</B> to read in chains from .txt files.
<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Exploring tails and high-significant limits</B><BR>
The <b>temperature</b> setting allows you to sample from P^(1/T) rather
than P - this is good for exploring the tails of distributions, discovering
other local minima, and for getting more robust high-confidence error bars. See also the different <B>sampling_method</B>s.
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="Checkpoint">
<LI><B>Checkpointing</B><BR>
 Set <B>checkpoint = T</B> in the .ini file to checkpoint: i.e. generate files so that if the processes are terminated they can be restarted again from close to where they left off. With MPI this setting creates file_root.chk files used to store the current status. To continue a prematurely terminated run, just run again using exactly the same commands and files as originally. Note that if you use checkpointing, but you want to overwrite existing chains of the same name, you must manually delete all the file_root.* files (otherwise it will attempt to continue from where they left off). Please note this feature is not fantastically well tested, please let us know of any problems. Also note that for checkpointing to work the first run must run for at least past the initial burn phase (you can see when the file_root.chk files have been produced), otherwise the run will just start from scratch again.
</UL>

<A NAME="Output">
<B><FONT COLOR="blue">Output files</FONT></B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>The program produces  <B>file_root_1.txt</B>, <B>file_root_2.txt</B> etc, files listing each accepted set of
parameters for each chain; the first column gives the number of iterations staying at
that parameter set (more generally, the sample weight), and the second the likelihood.  <BR><BR>
<LI>A <B>file_root.paramnames</B> file lists the names and labels of the parameters corresponding to the columns 3+ of the output chain files. By default this is just a copy of the params_CMB.paramnames file read in by the default parameterization specified in params_CMB.f90. Parameter names are strings of numbers and letters without spaces, used reference parameters in input files; the labels are used when making plot axes labels and various output files.
<BR><BR>
<LI>A <B>file_root.ranges</B>  lists the name tags of the parameters, and their upper and lower bounds (including parameters that are not varied, where upper and lower are equal to the fixed value)
<BR><BR>
<LI>Files  <B>file_root_1.dat</B>,  <B>file_root_2.dat</B>, etc., if <b>indep_sample</b> is non-zero. These contain full computed
model information at the independent sample points (power spectra etc). These can be used for quick importance sampling using action=1.<BR><BR>
<LI>A <B>file_root.log</B> file
contains some info which may be useful to assess performance.<BR><BR>
<LI>For post-processing (action=1), the program reads in an existing .data file and processes
according to the redo_xxx parameters. At this point the acceptance multiplicities
are non-integer, and the output is already thinned by whatever the original
<b>indep_sample</b>
parameter was. The post-processed file are output to files with root <b>redo_outroot</b>.
</UL>


<A NAME="jobscript"></A>
<B><FONT COLOR="blue">Configuring job settings for your machine</FONT></B>
<P>
The <b>runMPI.py</b> and <b>runbatch.py</b> submission scripts use a job template file to submit jobs to the queue on your cluster.
The <b>job_script</b> files is supplied as sample, and you may need to make your own template specific to the configuration of your machine, depending on what queuing system you have (e.g. PBS, SLURM, etc.)
Recommended steps are
<UL>
<LI>If necessary, copy <b>job_script</b> to a new file, e.g. <b>job_script_mycluster</b> which you will then edit
<LI>If necessary, edit the template script:
<UL>
<LI>Things of the form <b>##tag##</b> are placeholders, and are replaced by relevant values for each run. Leave these as is, just edit the surrounding text so they are put in the right places.
<LI>The line starting <b>##RUN:</b> gives the template for each mpirun command used to actually run jobs.
<LI>Lines of the form <b>##DEFAULT_xxx: yyy ##</b> give names of specific commands or settings on your machine, for example <b>##DEFAULT_qsub: msub ##</b> sets the job submission command to "qsub".
</UL>
<LI>Set <b>COSMOMC_xxx</b> environment variable in your .bashrc to give the name of the script template filename, and any other job setting defaults that you want to override from the job template used. E.g.
<pre>
export COSMOMC_job_template=job_script_mycluster
export COSMOMC_coresPerNode=8
export COSMOMC_nodes=2
export COSMOMC_chainsPerNode=2
export COSMOMC_queue=default_queue
export COSMOMC_walltime=24:00:00
</pre>
</UL>
If necessary you can also edit the <b>submitJob</b> function in <b>python/paramgrid/jobqueue.py</b>, but most things can be configured via the template and .bashrc settings.
You can change the number of chains, nodes, walltime etc when submitting a job by using optional parameters to runMPI.py and runbatch.py: see <b>-h</b> help for available options.
</P>


<A NAME="Analysing"><h2 style ="color:darkred">Analysing samples and plotting</h2></A>
There are now several ways you can analyse chain results:
<UL>
<LI>Using the <b>python/GetDist.py</b> program (which can be run without having a fortran compiler installed).
<LI>With the GetDist Gui interactive program, in <b>python/GetDistGUI.py</b>.  See the <A HREF="readme_gui.html">GetDist GUI readme</A>.
<LI>Programmatically, using the python modules via <A HREF="readme_python.html">python scripts</A>.
<LI>Using the <b>getdist</b> program, compiled with Fortran (used by Planck 2015 chains, but now deprecated)
</UL>
The <b>GetDist</b> programs analyses text chain files produced by the cosmomc program. These are a group of plain text files of the form
<blockquote>
<pre>
xxx_1.txt
xxx_2.txt
...
xxx.paramnames
xxx.ranges
</pre>
</blockquote>

where "xxx" is some root filename, the .txt files are separate chain files, xxx.paramnames gives the names (and optionally latex labels) for each parameter, and xxx.ranges optionally specified bounds for each (named) parameter. The chain .txt files are in the format
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>weight like param1 param2 param3</i> ...
<p>The <i>weight</i> gives the number of samples (or importance weight)
with these parameters. <i>like</i> gives -log(likelihood), and <i>param1, param2...</i> are the values of the parameters at each point.
<P>
The .paramnames file lists the names of the parameters, one per line, optionally followed by a latex label.
Names cannot include spaces, and if they end in "*" they are interpreted as derived (rather than MCMC) parameters, e.g.
<blockquote>
<pre>
x1   x_1
y1   y_1
x2   x_2
xy*  x_1+y_1
</pre>
</blockquote>
The .ranges file gives hard bounds for the parameters, e.g.
<blockquote>
<pre>
x1  -5 5
x2   0 N
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that not all parameters need to be specified, and "N" can be used to denote that a particular upper or lower limit is unbounded. The ranges are used to determine
densities and plot bounds if there are samples near the boundary; if there are no samples anywhere near the boundary the ranges have no affect on plot bounds, which are chosen appropriately for the range of the samples.
<P>
The GetDist program, scripts and gui could be used completely independently of the CosmoMC program if you produce chains (or samples) in the same format
(see the pip-installable <A HREF="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GetDist/">python package</A>). If there is just one file of samples, you can also use xxx.txt without the _n number tag that's used to denote separate chains.

The GetDist program processes the chains and produces a set of output files giving marginalized constraints, convergence diagnostics, etc, and optionally some scripts for producing plots. This is convenient for bulk production of parameter constraints and first-look plotting; use the <A HREF="readme_python.html">python modules</A> in your own scripts if you need more fine-grained control.
<p>
Running using the python version
<blockquote>
<B>python python/GetDist.py [distparams.ini] [chains/chainroot]</B>
</blockquote>
or using compiled Fortran:
<blockquote>
<B>./getdist distparams.ini [chains/chainroot]</B>
</blockquote>
Here the parameter input file distparams.ini determines analysis parameters; in the python version this is optional, and if omitted defaults will be used. The chain root name to analyse can be given in the .ini file, or you can specify it as an optional parameter on the command line to quickly analyse different chains with the same settings. The parameter input file should be fairly self-explanatory,
and is in the same format as the cosmomc parameter input file. To make a new .ini file you can edit to customize settings use
<blockquote>
<B>python python/GetDist.py --make_param_file myparams.ini</B>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that the outputs from the python and fortran versions of GetDist are not identical due to slightly different algorithms, but should usually be consistent to better than the sampling noise for parameter means and limits. Both can produce pre-computed densities for plotting (in the <B>plot_data_dir</b> directory), but the python plotting scripts do not require this - output will be faster and make far fewer files if <b>plot_data_dir</b> is not set.

If you have a derived parameter which has a prior which cuts off when the posterior is non-negligible
you need to set the <b>limits[paramname]</b> variables to the corresponding limits
- for example r02 for the tensor ratio. Otherwise
limits are computed automatically. <i>DO NOT</i> use limits[paramname] to change
the bounds on other plots - the program uses the limits information when
it is estimating the posteriors from the samples. Limits for base MCMC parameters are set automatically from the .ranges file.
When limits[paramname] are used the .margestats file
 contains one tail statistics - i.e. the lower bound is where 1-x of points are lower and x of the points higher, the upper bound is where 1-x of the points are higher and x lower (usually only one of the limits would be used). If only one end is fixed you can use N the floating end, e.g. "limitsxx = 0 N" for the tensor amplitude which has a greater than zero prior.

<LI>Various parameters determine how sample densities are computed (see the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/GetDist.pdf">Kernel Density Estimation notes</A>).  The <B>smooth_scale_1D</b> and <B>smooth_scale_2D</B> parameters can be set to change the smoothing scale.
For smooth_scale_1D:
<UL>
<LI>if smooth_scale_1D &gt;= 1 smooth by smooth_scale_1D bin widths
<LI>if smooth_scale_1D&gt; 0  and &lt;1 smooth by Gaussian of smooth_scale_1D standard deviations in each parameter (around 0.2-0.3 is often good); this gets flat distributions nice and smooth without overly broadening well determined parameters
<LI>if smooth_scale_1D&lt; 0 uses automatic smoothing length (changes with parameter)-the overall smoothing length is scaled by abs(smooth_scale_1D) from very crude guess at best overall scale
</UL>
The behaviour for smooth_scale_2D is similar. Usually the default <b>=-1</b> setting can be used, which choose smoothing automatically, but changing it can be a good way to enforce a smaller smoothing scale (for example if you have too few samples, the auto-scaling will make the smoothing relatively large, which can sometimes make the results somewhat artificially better than they really are).

<A NAME="Convergence"><h2  style ="color:darkred">Convergence diagnostics</h2></A>

The <B>getdist</B> program will output convergence diagnostics, both short summary information when getdist is run, and also more detailed information in the file_root.converge file. When running with MPI the first two of the parameters below can also be calculated when running the chains for comparison with a stopping criterion (see the .ini input file).
<UL>
<LI>For multiple chains the code computes the Gelman and Rubin "variance of chain means"/"mean of chain variances" R statistic for each parameter using the second half of each chain (<A HREF="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.55.1675">reference</A>). The <B>.converge</B> file produced by getdist contains the numbers for each parameter individually. The program also writes out the value for the worst eigenvalue of the covariance of the means, which should be a worst case (catching poor chain coverage in directions not aligned with the base parameters). This "R-1" statistic is also used for the stopping criterion when generating chains with MPI.
If the numbers are much less than one then the second half of each chain probably provides an accurate estimate of the means and variances. If the distribution is bimodal and no chains find the second mode low values can be misleading. Typically you want the value to be less than 0.1, or lower if you want means to high accuracy or to make nice 2D density plots (0.01 is often fine). Low values do not guarantee that small percentiles will be measured accurately (though it certainly helps), or that the value won't increase as you run longer and probe further into the tails.<BR><BR>
<LI>
For MPI runs, in addition to specifying a stopping criterion as above, you can also give a convergence criterion for a confidence limit. In general it is much harder to get an accurate value for a small confidence value than for the mean, so imposing a tight limit may make your chains run for a very long time (though you can then be pretty confident in your confidence). The value computed is the variance of the chain percentiles from the last half of the different chains, in units of the standard deviation of each parameter. You can either specify a particular parameter to check, or do all of them. Any parameter with a slowly explored tail will only converge very slowly, in which case you may be able to improve things by generating chains at a higher temperature (so the tails are explored more readily; GetDist can adjust for the temperature automatically), or re-parameterizing.
<BR><BR>
<LI>The auto-correlation length gives a measure of how independent the samples are, with the total number of samples divided by the length giving an estimate of an effective number of independent samples.
Two auto-correlation lengths are computed, in 'weight' units and 'sample' units. The latter is in units of the number of rows in the chain file, the former is the "weight mass' that determines the correlation length; for definitions see the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/GetDist.pdf">GetDist notes</A>.
<BR><BR>
<LI>
For individual chains (before importance sampling) getdist computes the Raftery and Lewis convergence diagnostics. This uses a binary chain derived from each parameter depending on whether the parameter is above or below a given percentile of its distribution (specified by the <b>converge_test_limit</b> input parameter). The code works out how much the binary chain needs to be thinned to approximate a Markov process better than a second order process, and then uses analytical results for the convergence of binary Markov chains to assess the burn in period. It also assesses the thin factor needed for the binary chain to approximate an independence chain, which gives an idea of how much you need to thin the chain to obtain independent samples (i.e. how much you can get away with thinning it for importance sampling, though thinning isn't entirely lossless). The .converge file contains the numbers for each chain used, getdist writes out the worst case.  See this <A HREF="http://www.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/raftery92how.pdf">reference</A> for details.<BR><BR>
<LI>
A simpler way to assess the error on quantile limits is by computing them using subsets of the samples. GetDist produces the file_root.converge contains the 'split-test' rms change on the parameter quantiles in units of the standard deviation when the samples are split into 2,3 or 4 parts. Small numbers are clearly better. A number of 0.5 for a 2-way split indicates that the 95% confidence limit may in fact be off by the order of half a standard deviation (though probably better, as the limit is computed using all the samples). Large values in a particular parameter may indicate that there is a long tail that is only being explored slowly (in which case generating the chain at a higher temperature or changing parameters to the log might help).
<!--
<BR><BR>
<LI>The file_root.converge file also outputs the parameter auto-correlations as a function of step separation (see e.g. <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/astro-ph/0310723">astro-ph/0310723</A>). The correlation length is similar to the Raftery&Lewis statistics in giving a measure (though harder to quantify) of how far apart independent samples are, though it is less sensitive to how well the tails are explored (see bad case example in the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/CosmoMC.pdf">notes</A>).

<B><FONT COLOR="blue">Differences between GetDist and MPI run-time statistics</FONT></B><BR><BR>
GetDist will cut out <B>ignore_rows</B> from the beginning of each chain, then compute the R statistic using all of the remaining samples. The MPI run-time statistic uses the last half of all of the samples. In addition, GetDist will use all the parameters, including derived parameters. If a derived parameter has poor convergence this may show up when running GetDist but not when running the chain (however the eigenvalues of covariance of means is computed using only base parameters). The run-time values also use thinned samples (by default every one in ten), whereas GetDist will use all of them. GetDist will allow you to use only subsets of the chains.

<P>
Parameters like H0 and omegal (&Omega;<sub>&Lambda;</sub>) are derived from the above. Using theta rather than H0 is more efficient as it is much less correlated with other parameters. There is an implicit prior 40 &lt; H0  &lt; 100 (which can be changed).
The .txt chain files list derived parameters after the base parameters.
The list of parameter names and labels used in the default parameterization is listed in the supplied <b>params_CMB.paramnames</b> file.
</P>
<P>
Since the program uses a covariance matrix for the parameters, it knows about (or will learn about) linear combination degeneracies. In particular ln[10^10 A_s]&nbsp;-&nbsp;2*tau is well constrained, since exp(-2tau)A_s determines the overall amplitude of the observed CMB anisotropy (thus the above parameterization explores the tau-A degeneracy efficiently). The supplied covariance matrix will do this even if you add new parameters.
</P>
<P>
Changing parameters does in principle change the results as each base parameter has a flat prior. However for well constrained parameters this effect is very small. In particular using theta rather than H_0 has a small effect on marginalized results.
</P>
<P>
The above parameterization does make use of some knowledge about the physics, in particular the (approximate) formula for the sound horizon.
<!--Also supplied is a <B>params_H.f90</B> file which uses H_0,z_re and A_s instead of theta, tau and log(10^10 A_s) which is more generic. Though slower to converge, this may be useful if you want to play around with different extended models - just edit the Makefile to use params_H.f90 instead of params_CMB.f90. Sample input files and covariance matrix along with params_H.f90 are <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/params_H.tar.gz">available here</A>. Since the parameters have a different meaning in this parameterization, you should not try to mix .covmat (or other) files with those from the default parameterization. Note this file tends to get out of synch with the latest CosmoMC version.
-->
To change parameterization make a new .paramnames file, then change sources/params_CMB.f90 to change the mapping of physical parameters to MCMC array indices, and also to read in your new .paramnames file.

<LI><B>April 2014</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>CAMB update to April 2014 version; cosmomc support added for running of running (<b>nrunrun</b>) and running tensor tilt (<b>ntrun</b>). Using <b>inflation_consistency</b> now uses second order consistency relations for nt and ntrun.
<LI>Added tensor pivot parameter <b>tensor_pivot_k</b> to specify pivot scale for r independently of the scalar pivot scale. This uses the new CAMB tensor parameterization (tensor_parameterization=2) so that A<sub>t</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;P<sub>t</sub>(tensor_pivot_k) = r P<sub>s</sub>(tensor_pivot_k) for any scalar pivot, tilt and running.
<LI>Re-ordered derived parameters, and added new tensor derived parameters r<sub>0.01</sub> (<b>rBB</b>), log(10<sup>10</sup>A<sub>t</sub>) (<b>logAT</b>), and 10<sup>9</sup>A<sub>t</sub> (<b>AT</b>),  10<sup>9</sup> A<sub>t</sub> e<sup>-2&tau;</sup> (<b>ctlamp</b>)

<LI>GetDist has new optional second parameter to specify file_root, e,g <I>getdist distparams.ini chains/test</i>
<LI>GetDist <b>chain_num</b> can now either be unspecified or -1 in order to read as many chains as exist
<LI>python/makeTables.py has new options <b>delta_chisq_paramtag</b> to specify reference parameter model for quoting &Delta;&chi;<sup>2</sup> to (default is baseline model), <b>changes_from_datatag</b> to give shifts in parameter means (in sigma) relative to the specified data tag at the same parameter combination, and <b>changes_from_paramtag</b> to give shifts relative to some baseline parameter combination
<LI>python/batchJob.py has new convenience jobGroup class for optional use in grid setting files; dataSet class has <b>add</b> method to modifying existing content

<UL>
<LI>Major restructuring of main code using Fortran 2008: structure supports additional cosmology calculator codes, etc. Use ifort 14+.
<LI>Re-written CMB likelihoods; new CMBlikes module replaces the (mis-named) Planck_like, with support for exact forecasting and binned HL likelihoods (e.g. <A HREF="http://bicepkeck.org/">BICEP2</A>); runtime determination of L-ranges and fields needed. (.data format changed); old CMB data format support removed for now.
<LI>Added <A HREF="http://bicepkeck.org/">BICEP2</A> data likelihood files (in ./data/BICEP/)
<LI>New JLA supernovae likelihood module (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4064">arXiv:1401.4064</A>)

<LI>Updated BBN module, using interpolation table (from <A HREF="http://superiso.in2p3.fr/relic/alterbbn/">AlterBBN</A>) with updated neutron decay constant and converting from BBN to total mass conventions for Y<sub>P</sub>. Uses new Interpolation module with reusable 2D bicubic interpolation class. Changes in Y<sub>P</sub> are O(1%) and hence have only tiny effect on other parameters.
<LI>Fixed bugs when using LSS, including one giving wrong sigma8 (thanks Matteo Costanzi)
<LI>CAMB updated to December 2013 version (minor changes)

<LI><B>October 2013</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>CAMB updated to October 2013 version  (inc. Jason Dossett changes to support non-linear lensing and non-linear MPK, changing numerical results slightly; fix for ppf bug that significantly changes results at low L for w&gt;&gt;-0.8, thanks David Rapetti and Matteo Cataneo)
<LI>Added WiggleZ and MPK modules, and corresponding general changes for likelihoods using the linear or non-linear matter power spectrum as a function of redshift. Double interpolation is now avoided, and combinations of requirements for different likelihoods are automatically internally combined. (All thanks to Jason Dossett)
<LI>Added halofit_ppf (Jason Dossett)
<LI>Minimization now has more options, including high-temperature MCMC check, and uses existing .covmat for widths: best fits seems to be a lot more stable now; also MPI support to compare result from multiple minimizations (not usually required)
<LI>Added checkConflicts to likelihood class (so new likelihoods can check full list for conflicts and abort if necessary e.g. BAO/MPK) and added .dataset file-based likelihood ancestor class, with conflict specification input parameters
<LI>New python plotting options and Planck default settings; sample Planck output scripts updated
</UL>

</UL>
<LI><B>March 2013</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Sampling</B>
<UL>
<LI>New fast-slow <b>sampling_method=7</b>, using new fast/slow blocked decorrelation scheme (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4473">paper</A>) and fast dragging following <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/math.ST/0502099">Neal 2005</A>. This is recommended for Planck.
    <UL>
    <LI><b>fast_param_index</b> specifies that all parameters with number greater or equal to fast_param_index should be treated as fast. Can alternatively use <B>fast_parameters</b> to set specific parameter to be treated as fast.
    <LI><b>dragging_steps</b> determines the number of fast steps per slow step. In total dragging_steps x num_fast metropolis steps are taken in the fast direction for each slow step. Does not need to be an integer, 2-3 works well for Planck.
     <LI>for fine-tuning <b>block_semi_fast</b> boolean defines whether initial power spectrum parameters are treated as separate blocks, <b>block_fast_likelihood_params</b> determines if fast parameters are blocked depending on likelihood dependencies. Both true (default) is usually fastest.

<LI><B>Grids of models and python utilities</B>
<UL>
<LI>A new suite of python scripts for running CosmoMC for grids of models, running GetDist over the result, management, analysis and plotting. See the <A hREF="readme_python.html">python scripts readme</A>
</UL>
<LI><B>Structure</B>
<UL>
<LI>Restructuring using Fortran 2003 features (probably does not compile on gfortran, ifort 13 OK); likelihoods and theory now only re-computed as required as parameters change (enables the fast-slow sampling method to work). Each likelihood specifies its own theory and nuisance parameter requirements.
<LI>Data likelihoods now specify their own .paramnames file for any nuisance parameters (samples in ./data). Combining theory and data parameters is done internally, there's no need to change hard-coded parameter numbers when new nuisance parameters are added, and unused likelihood nuisance parameter are no longer output. Each likelihood function is passed the array of its nuisance parameters, completely independent of what other likelihoods are doing (but multiple likelihood functions can use the same nuisance parameter names when they are the same parameter). Likelihoods specify their speed (<0 is slow, >=0 is fast, with higher faster), and are internally sorted to be in speed order before use.
<LI>Reorganized parameterization class and module implementation; can now set H0_min and H0_max as .ini input parameters. Added <b>parameterization=background</b> option (e.g. for supernovae-only runs): parameter numbers can now be changed dynamically without re-compiling.
</UL>
<LI><B>CAMB and cosmology</B>
<UL>
<LI>CAMB (and CosmoMC) updates fix issues with larger neutrino masses and non-linear calculation in very closed models (Mar 2013 version)
<LI>Added support for massive neutrinos with varying n_eff (nnu), treating massive as nearly thermal and the rest as massless (for n>3.046), or reducing the temperature of the massive neutrinos for n<3.046.
<LI>Added <b>use_lensing_potential</b> and <b>use_nonlinear_lensing</b> (currently can't be used with any LSS data; also note that it is not calculated consistency when only the initial power spectra are changed). Changed default num_cls_ext=1.
    Lensing potential accuracy increased for use_lensing_potential=T.
<LI>Derived parameters now include r_s/D_v(0.57)
<LI>T_CMB changed to 2.7255

<LI>BAO data up dated to BOSS DR9 <A HREF="http://www.sdss3.org/science/boss_publications.php">final results</A> (DR7, DR9 and 6DF). Note the code is not identical, cosmomc computes the drag sound horizon numerically (recalibrated to be consistent in the fiducial model); also be aware of correlation with Wigglez.
<LI>HST data updated to Riess et al: 1103.2976 (from BOSS mod)
<LI>Updated for WMAP9 (edit the Makefile in your wmap_likelihood_v5 directory appropriately first).

<LI>estimate_propose_matrix outputs file in named parameter .covmat compatible format and copes better with parameters with hard prior cuts
<LI>CAMB October 2012 update: tweaked recfast model and support for compiling CosmoMC with CosmoRec and HyRec recombination codes; updated halofit model
<LI>.ini files support reading in file of default parameter values that can then be overridden (greatly reduce duplication between similar runs), e.g. DEFAULT(baseparameter_defaults.ini);  can be used in nested way, and with INCLUDE.

New GetDist option <B>num_contours</B> to produce more than two sets of limits.

<LI><B>April 2008</B><BR>
Includes latest CAMB version with new reionization parameterization - default now assumes first ionization of helium happened at the same time as hydrogen, and z_re is defined as the point where x<sub>e</sub> is half its maximum (the optical depth and z_re are related in a way independent of the speed of the transition in the new parameterization). This changes the z_re numbers at the ~6% level. Fixed bug reading in mpk parameters.

Added support for SDSS LRG data (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608632">astro-ph/0608632</A>; thanks to Licia Verde, Hiranya Peiris and Max Tegmark). CAMB fixes and other minor changes.


<LI><B>August 2006</B><BR>
Improved speed of GetDist 2D plot generation, added limitsxxx support when smoothing = F. Added <A HREF="#sampling">sampling_method</A> = 5,6, preliminary implementations of multicanonical and Wang-Landau sampling for nasty (e.g. multi-modal) distributions (currently does not compute Evidence, just generates weighted samples). Changed matter_power_minkh (cmbtypes) to work around potential rounding errors on some computers. Updated <A HREF="http://camb.info">CAMB</A> following August 2006 version. Added warning about missing limits<b>xx</b> parameters to getdist. Added <B>MPI_Max_R_ProposeUpdateNew</B> parameter (when varying parameters that are fixed in covmat). Updated CBI data files.

<LI><B>May 2006</B><BR>
Supernovae.f90 updated to use SNLS by default, edit to use Riess Gold. 2dF updated (twodf.f90 file deleted, use 2df_2005.dataset); covariance matrix support in mpk.f90.
Fixed bug using LSS with non-flat models. Improved error checking and Matlab 7 enhancements in getdist. Getdist auto column counting with columnnum=0, various hidden extra options now shown in sample distparams.ini. Extra fix for confid2D. Fixed MPI thinning bug in utils.F90. Makefile fixes. Fixed mpk.f90 analytical marginalization (since March 2006). SDSS likelihood now computed from k/h=1e-4.

<LI><B>April 2006</B><BR>
Fixed bug in lya.f90 (SDSS lyman-alpha now the default; lya.f90 now includes Croft by default). Fixes to Confid2D Matlab script. Added .covmat files for WMAP with running and tensors, and basic Planck simulation. Fixed version confusion in GetDist (one-tail limits set to prior limit value).

<LI><B>March 2006</B><BR>
Updated for 3-year WMAP. Added <B>use_lya</B> to include lyman-alpha data (standard LCDM only). Default in lya.f90 is LUQAS (can also compile with SDSSLy-a-v3.f90 for SDSS).
New Matlab <A HREF="#CustPlotting">scripts</A> for producing solid contour and 4D plots. New <B>checkpoint</B> option to generate <A HREF="#Checkpoint">checkpoint</A> files and continue terminated runs.
Added action=1 parameters <B>redo_add</B> (adds new likelihoods rather than recalculating) and <B>redo_from_text</B> (if you don't have .data files). Added <B>pivot_k</B> and <B>inflation_consistency</B> for use with default power spectrum parameterization.

<LI><B>July 2005</B><BR>
Added <B>get_sigma8</B> to force calculation of &sigma;<sub>8</sub>. Updated .newdat CMB dataset format (also added B03 data files).

Updated <A HREF="http://camb.info">CAMB</A> for new accurate lensed <I>C<sub>l</sub></I> calculation of <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0502425">astro-ph/0502425</A>. Minor changes to getdist (new <B>Matlab_version</B> input parameter,  <B>all_limits</B> to set same limits for all parameters). cmbdata.f90 includes new format used by BOOMERANG/CBI for polarization.

<LI><B>October 13 2004</B><BR>
Fixed bug in mpk.f90 when using 2df. Changes to GetDist for compatibility with Matlab 7. Fixed Makefile_intel (though now obsolete if you have Intel fortran v8).

<LI><B>October 2004</B><BR>
Added mpk.f90 for reading in general (multiple) matter power spectrum data files in a similar way to CMB dataset files  - corresponding changes to input parameter file. Included SDSS data files (note CosmoMC only models linear spectrum).
Various minor bug fixes and improved MPI error handling. Included (though not compiled by default) supernovae_riess_gold.f90 file to include more recent supernova data. Some mscripts fixes for compatibility with Matlab 7.

<LI><B>August 2004</B><BR>
Improved proposal density for efficient handling of fast and slow parameters, plus more robust distance proposal (should see significant speed improvement). New <B>sampling_method</B> parameter: new options for slice sampling (robust) and directional gridding (robust and efficient use of fast parameters). Also option to use slice sampling for burn in (more robust than Metropolis in many cases), then switch to Metropolis (faster with good covariance matrix). See the <A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/notes/CosmoMC.pdf">notes</A> for details. Improved MPI handling and minor bug fixes. Fixed effect of reionization on CAMB's lensed <I>C<sub>l</sub></I> results.

<LI><B>June 2004</B><BR>
Uses June 2004 CAMB version: bessel_cache.camb file no longer produced or needed (prevents MPI problems). Increased sig figs of chain output and GetDist analysis. New parameter propose_scale, the ratio of proposal width to st. dev., default 2.4 (following <A HREF="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/theory7.ps">Roberts, Gelman, Gilks</A>, <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405462">astro-ph/0405462</A>) - often significantly speeds convergence (parameters in .ini file are now estimates of the st. dev., not desired proposal widths).  Added MPI_R_StopProposeUpdate to stop updating proposal covariance matrix after a given convergence level has been reached. Added accuracy_level parameter to run at higher CAMB accuracy level (may be useful for forecasting).

<LI><B>March 2004</B><BR>
Added new VSA and CBI datasets. Added first_band= option to .dataset files to cut out low l that aren't wanted. CAMB pivot scale for tensors changed to 0.05/MPc (same as scalar). Fixed various compiler compatibility issues. Corrected CMB_lensing parameter in sample .ini file. Fixed minor typo in params_CMB.f90. Fixed reading in of MPI_Limit_Converge parameter in driver.F90.
Fixed bounds checking in MatterPowerAt (harmless with 2df). Added an exact likelihood calculation/data format to cmbdata.f90 for polarized full sky CMB <I>C<sub>l</sub></I>.

<LI><B>December 2003</B><BR> Added MPI support, with stopping on convergence and optional proposal density updating. Added calculation of matter power spectrum at different redshifts using CAMB (settings in cmbtypes.f90). Fixed bug when restarting chains using "continue_from" parameter [March 2006: now obsolete], and a few compiler compatibility issues.  Updated CAMB for more accurate non-flat model results. Added output of parameter auto-correlations to GetDist, along with support for ignore_rows&lt;1 to cut out a fraction of the chain and percentile split-test error estimators. Changed proposal density to proposal a random number of parameter changes on each step. Added GetDist samples_are_chains option - if false, rows can be any samples of anything (starting in column one, without an importance weight or likelihood value as produced by CosmoMC) - useful for analysing samples that don't come from CosmoMC. Added GetDist auto_label parameter to label parameters automatically by their parameter number.
<LI><B>July 2003</B><BR>  Fixed bug in MCMC.f90 affecting all raw chains - weights and likelihoods were displaced by one row. Post-processed results were correct, and effect on parameters is very small. Minor bug fixes in GetDist. Can now make file_root.read file to be read by all chains file_root_1, file_root_2, etc (this file is not auto-deleted after being read).
<LI><B>May 2003</B><BR> Added support for 'triangle' plots to GetDist (<A HREF="http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/power/fig5.ps">example</A>. Set triangle_plot=T in the .ini file). If truncation is required, the covariance matrix for CMB data sets is now truncated (rather than truncating the inverse covariance). Fixed CAMB bug with non-flat models, and problem setting CAMB parameters when run separately from CosmoMC.
<LI><B>March 4 2003</B><BR> Fixed bug in GetDist - the .margestats file produced contained incorrect limits (the mean and stddev were OK)
<LI><B>Feb 2003</B><BR> Support for WMAP data (customized code fixes TE and amplitude bugs).  CMB computation now uses <I>C<sub>l</sub></I> transfer functions - complete split possible between transfer functions and the initial power spectrum, so improved efficiency handling fast parameters. Bug fixes and tidying of proposal function. Initial power spectrum no longer assumed smooth for P_k. GetDist limitsxxx variables can be N to auto-size one end (margestats are still one tail). Support of IBM XL fortran (workarounds for bug on Seaborg). GetDist will automatically compute some chain statistics to help diagnose convergence and accuracy. CAMB updated, including more accurate and faster handling of tight coupling. Option to generate chains including CMB lensing effect. Various other changes.
<LI><B>Nov 2002</B><BR> Added support for polarization, and improved compatibility with different compilers and systems.

<A NAME="FAQ"><h2  style ="color:darkred">FAQ</h2></A>
<OL>
<LI><B>What are the dotted lines on the plots?</B><BR>
Dotted lines are mean likelihoods of samples, solid lines are marginalized probabilities. For Gaussian distributions they should be the same. For skew distributions, or if chains are poorly converged, they will not be. Sometime there is a much better fit (giving high mean likelihood) in a small region of parameter space which has very low marginalized probability. There is more discussion in the original  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205436">paper</a>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><B>What's in the .likestats file produced by getdist?</B><BR>
These are values for the best-fit sample, and projections of the n-Dimensional confidence region. Usually people only look at the best-fit values. The n-D limits give you some idea of the range of the posterior, and are much more conservative than the marginalized limits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><B>I'm writing a paper "constraints on X". How do I add X to cosmomc?</B><BR>
To add new <b>theory</b> parameters
<UL>
<LI>add the definition of the physical parameter to CMBParams in CosmologyTypes.f90
 <LI>Change CosmologyParameterizations.f90 to add a new parameterization or modify an existing one. In particular the <b>InitWithSetNames</b>  (<b>_Init</b>) procedure has
<pre>
call SetTheoryParameterNumbers(num_slow_params,num_semi_slow_params)
</pre>
which sets the number of hard and semi-hard parameters (the latter being things like initial power spectrum parameters).
Make a new .paramnames file with the new parameter names in and change
 and then
<pre>
call this%Initialize(Ini,Names, 'params_CMB.paramnames', Config)
</pre>
to set your new parameter names file.
<LI>Modify Calculator_CAMB.f90 (the CAMBCalc_CMBToCAMB procedure) to pass your new CMBParams parameters to CAMB to actually change the result
<LI>Edit your .ini files to add range and width settings for the new parameter names
</UL>
<BR>
If instead your parameter is a <b>likelihood</b> parameter (nuisance parameter), the new parameter can be handled entirely inside your likelihood function code (see supernovae_JLA.f90 for a simple example that has two nuisance parameters): you just set the .paramnames file (which determines the number of new parameters), and then use them when passed in to your likelihood function. See Likelihood_Cosmology.f90 for likelihood classes that your likelihood can extend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI><B>Why do some chains sometimes appear to get stuck?</B><BR>
Usually this is because the starting position for the chain is a long way from the best fit region. Since the marginal distributions of e.q. A_s are rather narrow, it can take a while for chains to move from into an acceptable region of A_s exp(-2&tau;). The cure is to check your starting parameter values and start widths (especially make sure the widths are not too wide-- too small is better than too wide when running with MPI), or to use a sampling method that is more robust (e.g. use <B>sampling_method</B> = 7). If you are patient, stuck chains should eventually find a sensible region of parameter space anyway. Occasionally the staring position may be in a corner of parameter space so that prior ranges prevent any reasonable proposed moves. In this case check your starting values and ranges, or just try re-starting the chain (a different random starting position will possibly be OK).
